# DRR-21-Mern

## Description

With this project, I was given starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and was tasked to refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
